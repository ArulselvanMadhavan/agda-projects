* Programming Language Foundations in Agda
** Preface
   - Proposition as types asserts that a certain kind of formal
     structure may be read in two ways - either as proposition in
     logic or type in computing.
   - A related structure may be read as either the proof of the
     proposition or as a programme of the corresponding type.
   - Aims to teach operational semantics of a programming languages,
     with simply-typed lambda calculus.
